!! [[Description]]

A simple script for running [[Red]] test files.

!! [[Tech Stack]]

* [[Red Utilities / Watch]]

!! [[Overview]]

One of my [[Red Utilities]].

Not much to say about this. It's a useful example of how to use [[Red Utilities / Watch]] to run test files. Simple enough but proved useful in the development of [[Red Utilities]].
