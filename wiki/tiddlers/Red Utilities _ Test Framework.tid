!! [[Description]]

A simple test framework for [[Red]] code.

!! [[Overview]]

One of my [[Red Utilities]].

This utility is simple enough. It provides a means of running and logging a hierarchy of testing functions: `suite`, `test`, and `assert`. It has 3 different levels of verbosity. Not much else to it, really.

This utility was used in the development and [[testing|Testing]] of some of the other [[Red Utilities]], and proved very useful.
