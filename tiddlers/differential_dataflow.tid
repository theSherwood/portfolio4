This is just an [[experiment|Experiments]] based on the ideas of [[Frank McSherry]] and his [[Differential Dataflow]]. This implementation is written in [[Nimskull]] and relies on my [[dynamic_value]] lib. 

I want to come back to these ideas at some point, but I'm not really doing much with [[Nimskull]]. So this particular experiment probably won't see any more development.

See the [ext[repo|https://github.com/theSherwood/differential_dataflow]] for more information.
